With the country’s variety of influences throughout its rich history, its traditional cooking techniques, and the Filipinos’ knack for combining flavours and making the most of any and all ingredients at their disposal, what results is unpretentious, no-frills food that’s simply delicious.</p>

                                <p>It’s the Filipino dish everybody knows — the mighty adobo. It is made by stewing meat (usually chicken, pork, or a combination of both) in soy sauce and vinegar, adding peppercorns and bay leaves for that special flavour. Bonus leftovers tip: pull the meat from the bone and fry ’til crispy for some tasty adobo flakes.</p>

After all, it is hard to top a tasty, fully-roasted pig with perfectly crisp skin and juicy meat. Find the best of this sinful treat on the island of Cebu, but this is almost always served at any grand Pinoy gathering or fiesta.</p>

                                <p>Dumpling (饺子) has been an indispensable Chinese dish of the reunion dinner on Chinese New Year’s Eve, especially in the northern regions. It was invented by Zhang Zhongjing – the sage of Chinese medicine over 1,800 years ago to cure the frostbitten ears. Nowadays, people mix minced pork, chicken, mutton, or beef with chopped vegetables to make the filling, and then wrap it into a thin piece of dumpling skin and pinch the wrapper into the shape of an ear. On Chinese New Year, people also wrap brown sugar, coins, dates, or peanuts for a good omen.</p>
