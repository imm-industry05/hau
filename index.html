             <h3>What is Coffee?</h3>
             <p>Coffee is a brewed beverage made from the roasted seeds, or beans, of the coffee plant. Once the berries of the coffee plant are harvested, the flesh is removed and discarded, leaving only the seed. Prior to roasting the beans have a grey-green color and are referred to as green coffee because the beans are shelf-stable at this point, they are sold and shipped green.</p>
