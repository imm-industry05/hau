    <h4>About Holy Angel University</h4>
    <p>Holy Angel University has over 16,000 students, making it one of the biggest schools in Central Luzon. Established in 1933 by local philanthropist Juan D. Nepomuceno, it is considered the Philippines' first Catholic school founded by a layman instead of the usual diocese or religious congregation. It is also the first Catholic high school in the country that is co-educational, instead of the usual exclusively for boys or exclusively for girls.</p>
