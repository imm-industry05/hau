Krazy Kart

1. Inspired from the the popular 1990's game outrun. Made with love using java script to have a more dynamic interaction with the user.
2. Race against the time with randomly generated road to have a different experience every play. 
3. Use your keyboard's arrow keys to control the car. Up/Down is the acceleration and brake and the Left/Right is to steer the car.
4. Feedbacks are welcome to fine tune the control of the car and add more interesting stuff in the future
