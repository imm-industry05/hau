Krazy Kar

1. Inspired from the the popular 1990's game outrun. Made with love using java script to have a more dynamic interaction with the user.
2. Race against the time with randomly generated road to have a different experience every play. 
3. Use your keyboard's arrow keys to control the car. Up/Down is the acceleration and brake and the Left/Right is to steer the car.
4. Feedbacks are welcome to fine tune the control of the car and add more interesting stuff in the future.
5. Can be played with a low resolution mode and also available in HD!
6. My time is 31.051 seconds :) Try and beat it and share your results!
